# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This project calculates the **mean**, **variance**, **standard deviation**, **maximum**, **minimum**, and **sum** of rows, columns, and the flattened elements of a 3x3 matrix. The input to the calculator is a list containing exactly 9 numbers, which is converted into a 3x3 matrix for computations.

## Features
- Computes the following statistical measures:
  - Mean
  - Variance
  - Standard Deviation
  - Maximum
  - Minimum
  - Sum
- Results are provided for:
  - Each row
  - Each column
  - Flattened matrix (all elements)
- Raises a `ValueError` if the input list does not contain exactly 9 numbers.

## Project Structure
The project contains three main files:
1. **`mean_var_std.py`**: Implements the core logic for calculations.
2. **`test_module.py`**: Contains unit tests for the `calculate` function.
3. **`main.py`**: Entry point for running the tests.

## Installation
